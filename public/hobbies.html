    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>My hobby is my job. It’s a jobby! <br><i>– Graham Coxon</i></p>
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>I love music and everything related to it! I love listening to music, playing musical instruments, and even transcribing music. Although I cannot make my own music, I always surround myself with one. It helped me become more alive and it has helped me in so many ways.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Movies and Shows</h2>
    <p>From time to time, I watch movies and tv shows to help for leisure. Anything from action to romance, I watch them all depending on my mood. It is a great diversion tactic to escape the harsh reality of life.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>One Piece</b></li>
        <p>This is my favorite anime. The characters are well-written.</p>
        <li><b>Ace of Diamond</b></li>
        <p>This is my favorite sports anime. It tackles sportmanship, dreams, and hardwork.</p>
        <li><b>Spy x Family</b></li>
        <p>I love the show's concept. I love the balance of action and comedy in this show.</p>    
    </ul>
